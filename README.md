# My Meme pp

# Features
- Random Meme Image: Fetches a random meme image from the Imgflip API.

- Customizable Text: Users can enter custom text for the top and bottom of the meme.

- Responsive Design: The UI adjusts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.


# How It Works
- State Management: The project uses React's useState hook to manage the state of the meme image and text.

- Fetching Memes: The useEffect hook is used to fetch meme images from the Imgflip API when the component mounts.

- Random Image Selection: A random image is selected from the fetched memes when the "Get a new meme image" button is clicked.

- Text Input: The top and bottom text fields update the corresponding text on the meme in real-time.
